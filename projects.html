              <h3>What did I do?</h3>
                  <p>I worked with a small team of students to identify how data was shared,
                  both internally and externally, for the Society of College and University Planning.
                  Using qualitative data anlysis and user-research methods, I condensed the results
                  of 6 interviews to a few key takeaways.</p>
                  <p>In the end, I helped produce a report that outlined suggestions to improve data
                  sharing practices so that they are more in line with data security protocols such as
                  the GDPR.</p>

              <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
                  <p>I learned the benefits of working with a team, deligating tasks, and time management skills
                  in order to meet hard deadlines for various deliverables.</p>

          <div class="project-description">
              <h3>What did I do?</h3>
                  <p>I developed Python code in order to assess the combinatorical probability of drawing certain
                  hands of cards for a board game in development. I furthermore developed key metrics in order
                  to assess the game's balance. Ultimately, I produced a professional report with my recommendations
                  on where the game needed to be improved in order to be fair.</p>

              <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
                  <p>I learned how to interact with a client so that I can gather the correct information necessary
                  for my analysis, create the tools requisite for that analysis, and produce an informative and
                  useful deliverable at the end.</p>

          <div class="project-description">
              <h3>What did I do?</h3>
                  <p>As a final project for a graduate Python course, I produced a web application that displays,
                  sorts, and analyzes board game data. The data used was scraped from the boardgamegeek.com top 300
                  board games. I used MySQL to manage the database and Flask to create the application.</p>

              <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
                  <p>I learned how to combine data-gathering tools such as web scraping with visualization tools such
                  as Plotly and HTML to produce a full data pipeline. This was my first "full-stack" development
                  experience.</p>

          <div class="project-description">
              <h3>What did I do?</h3>
                  <p>I created a digital prototype of a mobile application that can be used to make the process
                  or board game prototyping more efficient. Board game playtesters will be able to access their
                  feedback at any time, and board game developers will be able to store feedback and production
                  logs easily. In order to produce this prototype, I used a variety of user-research techniques,
                  including interviews, storyboarding, user-testing, A/B tests, and others.</p>
                  <p>The full digital prototype is available for review <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/dbDF5acc08mSLmQk7jOGZhl2/TestQuest1.0?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

              <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
                  <p>I learned about user-reserch and how to apply concepts of accesibility into my designs.</p>

          <div class="project-description">
              <h3>What did I do?</h3>
                  <p>I used cutting-edge computer models in order to simulate atmospheric phenomena on a number of
                  scales, ranging from boundary-layer processes, to tornados, to climate. I wrote and defended
                  a thesis, as well as published a referreed scientific paper.</p>

              <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
                  <p>I learned how to work independently on a research problem, as well as how to learn new skills
                  on my own quickly in order to meet the requirements of a project.</p>
